### Bio 




I received my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from Colorado State University in December of 2018. In over 5 years of research, I gained experience in a number of modeling and data analysis techniques.

My dissertation research investigated the effects of microstructure on the superelasticity of 1:2:2 intermetallic compounds, studied with electronic structure simulation methods. During my PhD, I also completed visiting research studying twin and grain boundaries with classical atomistic simulations.

My Master's research involved predicting wastewater disinfection efficacy with computational fluid mechanics modeling coupled with machine learning techniques. I have a BS in Mechanical Engineering from The College of New Jersey, where I graduated Magna Cum Laude and earned an Electrical Engineering minor. I also spent a year on the New Product Development Engineering team at Hutchinson Inc. in Trenton, NJ.

My diverse computational, design, and engineering background make me a unique and exceptional candidate for the most challenging positions. I excel at focusing both on the small details and their places in the larger picture, bridging the gap between concept and implementation.
I am currently seeking a position which allows for me to utilize my skills to help build a smarter, faster, more efficient world.
