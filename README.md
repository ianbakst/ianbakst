### Bio 




I'm a Data Professional with over 4 years experience living in Boston, MA. I have built developed cloud-scalable microservices complete with SQL integration, prioritized job queues, and encrypted user API keys. I have also built interactive web apps complete with React UIs. My specialty is in leveraging Data Science techniques and Machine Learning to develop innovative, practical, deployable solutions to Data Problems.

I received my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from Colorado State University in December of 2018. In over 5 years of research, I gained experience in a number of modeling and data analysis techniques including Density Functional Theory (DFT), Classical Molecular Dynamics (MD), Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), Finite Element Analysis (FEA), and more.

My dissertation research, conducted under the guidance of my advisor Dr. Christopher Weinberger, investigated the effects of microstructure and point defects on the pseudoelasticity of 1:2:2 intermetallic compounds, studied with electronic structure simulation methods. During my Ph.D., I also completed visiting research studying twin and grain boundaries with classical atomistic simulations.

My Master's research involved predicting wastewater disinfection efficacy with computational fluid mechanics modeling coupled with machine learning techniques. I have a BS in Mechanical Engineering from The College of New Jersey, where I graduated Magna Cum Laude and earned an Electrical Engineering minor. I also spent a year on the New Product Development Engineering team at Hutchinson Inc. in Trenton, NJ.

My diverse background computational, design, and engineering background make me a unique and exceptional candidate for the most challenging positions. I excel at focusing both on the small details and their places in the larger picture, bridging the gap between concept and implementation.
I am currently seeking a position which allows for me to utilize my skills to help build a smarter, faster, more efficient world.
